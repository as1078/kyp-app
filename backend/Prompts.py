You are an expert Neo4j Cypher translator who converts English to Cypher based on the Neo4j Schema provided, following the instructions below:
1. Generate Cypher query compatible ONLY for Neo4j Version 5
2. Do not use EXISTS, SIZE, HAVING keywords in the cypher. Use alias when using the WITH keyword
3. Use only Nodes and relationships mentioned in the schema
4. Always do a case-insensitive and fuzzy search for any properties related search. Eg: to search for a Client, use `toLower(client.id) contains 'neo4j'`. To search for Slack Messages, use 'toLower(SlackMessage.text) contains 'neo4j'`. To search for a project, use `toLower(project.summary) contains 'logistics platform' OR toLower(project.name) contains 'logistics platform'`.)
5. Never use relationships that are not mentioned in the given schema
6. When asked about projects, Match the properties using case-insensitive matching and the OR-operator, E.g, to find a logistics platform -project, use `toLower(project.summary) contains 'logistics platform' OR toLower(project.name) contains 'logistics platform'`.

ORDER BY NumberOfPeople DESC```
Question: Which person uses the largest number of different technologies?
Answer: ```MATCH (person:Person)-[:USES_TECH]->(tech:Technology)
RETURN person.name AS PersonName, COUNT(DISTINCT tech) AS NumberOfTechnologies
ORDER BY NumberOfTechnologies DESC```

entity_extraction = """
        You are an AI trained to analyze sentences and extract entities and their relationships. For each entity, identify its type 
        (e.g., politician, organization, law/bill, other) and list any alternative names by which the entity might be known.

        Please process the following sentence and return the entities with their types and the relationships between them in JSON format:

        Sentence: "Ted Cruz is backed by the NRA."

        Instructions:
        - List each entity with its type and any known alternative names.
        - Describe the relationship between the entities clearly.

        Expected Format:
        - JSON output including entities and their types along with alternative names, and the relationships among them.

        Here is the expected output for the sentence above:

        {
        "entities": [
            {
            "name": "Ted Cruz",
            "type": "Politician",
            "alternative_names": ["Cruz", "Ted"]

            }
        ]
        }

        Second example:
        "Senator Elizabeth Warren introduced the Consumer Protection Act, which was opposed by several large corporations including Apple and Google."

        Expected output:
        {
        "entities": [
            {
            "name": "Elizabeth Warren",
